# Prompts

Sometimes there are common workflows for people using your MCP server you want
to make easier for users. You may not want your users to have to write the same
prompt all the time for that workflow (not everyone is a "prompt engineer").

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has a specification for **prompts** as a way
for servers to expose reusable, structured instructions to language models and
clients. Prompts are more than just static textâ€”they can be parameterized and
invoked by users to guide model behavior in a consistent, transparent way.

With prompts, servers can offer a menu of available instructions (like
"summarize my journal entries from last week," "write alt text for this image"
or "review this code"), each with a clear description and customizable
arguments. This enables richer, more user-driven interactions, where clients can
select and fill in prompts as needed.

For example, a server might expose a simple "hello world" prompt:

```ts
server.prompt('hello_world', 'Say hello to the user', {}, async () => ({
	messages: [
		{
			role: 'user',
			content: { type: 'text', text: 'Hello, world!' },
		},
	],
}))
```

Clients can discover available prompts, retrieve their templates, and supply
arguments to customize the resulting messages. Prompts can include not just
text, but also images, audio, or references to server-managed resourcesâ€”enabling
multi-modal and context-rich interactions.

This exercise will introduce you to MCP's prompt capabilities, showing how to
declare prompt support, register prompts with arguments, and return structured
messages for downstream use.
