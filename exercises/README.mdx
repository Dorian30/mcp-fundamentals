# MCP Fundamentals 🧱

👨‍💼 Hello, my name is Peter the Product Manager. I'm here to help you get
oriented and to give you your assignments for the workshop!

Welcome to **MCP Fundamentals**! In this workshop, you'll dive into the world of
the
[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18)—an
open protocol designed to seamlessly connect AI models with external data
sources and tools. Think of MCP as the "USB-C port" for AI applications: it
standardizes how LLMs (Large Language Models) access context, resources, and
capabilities from a wide variety of sources.

```mermaid

	subgraph "Application Host Process"
		H[Host]
		C1[Client 1]
		C2[Client 2]
		C3[Client 3]
		H --> C1
		H --> C2
		H --> C3
	end

	subgraph "Local machine"
		S1[Server 1<br>Files & Git]
		S2[Server 2<br>Database]
		R1[("Local<br>Resource A")]
		R2[("Local<br>Resource B")]

		C1 --> S1
		C2 --> S2
		S1 <--> R1
		S2 <--> R2
	end

	subgraph "Internet"
		S3[Server 3<br>External APIs]
		R3[("Remote<br>Resource C")]

		C3 --> S3
		S3 <--> R3
	end
```

Throughout this workshop, you'll learn:

- The core architecture of MCP: **hosts**, **clients**, and **servers**
  ([see architecture](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/architecture))
- How JSON-RPC powers communication and stateful sessions between components
- How to expose resources, prompts, and tools to LLMs using MCP
- How to build composable, secure, and extensible integrations for AI workflows

We'll focus on the fundamentals—no authentication or authorization required for
our exercises—so you can get hands-on experience with the protocol's most
important features.

If you're curious about the details, I highly recommend checking out the
[official MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18)
and the [introduction](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). These
resources provide a deep dive into the protocol, its design principles, and
practical implementation tips.
