# Embedded Resources

👨‍💼 Brilliant work! You've just unlocked a new level of interactivity by
embedding resources directly in your tool responses. Now your tools and
resources can work hand-in-hand, giving clients and LLMs richer, more actionable
results.

By including resource references (and even the resource data itself) in your
tool outputs, you've made it possible for users to seamlessly follow links,
fetch more details, and build powerful workflows that combine actions and
context.

Key takeaways from this step:

- How to embed resource references in tool responses using `type: 'resource'`
- How to provide the correct URI and metadata for each resource
- How to deliver both the reference and the resource data itself for maximum
  flexibility

With this, your MCP server is ready to power truly context-aware, intelligent
applications. Great job!

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to apply what we just did to all the tools. If you'd like to
