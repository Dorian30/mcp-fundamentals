# Linked Resources

👨‍💼 You've already made your resources discoverable and accessible—now let's make
them even more useful! In this step, you'll learn how to link a resource
directly in your tool responses.

Why does this matter? Sometimes, a tool's output isn't just plain text—it might
be a file, a database record, or some other structured data. By linking to
resource references, you enable clients (and LLMs) to follow links to additional
context, download files, subscribe to updates, or fetch related data on demand.

Your goal in this step:

- Update your tools so that, when they create a tag, we tell them it was created
  and also include a reference to the tag (using the `type: 'resource_link'`
  content type in the response).
- Make sure the resource includes the correct URI and metadata, so clients can
  easily fetch the resource if they want more details.

This pattern unlocks powerful workflows—tools and resources working together to
provide richer, more actionable results.

Here's an example of the content type if we were to link to a taco ingredient
resource:

```json
{
	"type": "resource_link",
	"uri": "taco://ingredients/1",
	"name": "Lettuce",
	"description": "A delicious lettuce ingredient",
	"mimeType": "application/json"
}
```

To test this out, create a new tag and notice the resource is included in the
response.
