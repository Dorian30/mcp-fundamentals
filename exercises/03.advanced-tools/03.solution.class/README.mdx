# Class

🦉 Olivia the Owl here! I just wanted to call out the fact that there's no
strict requirement to structure your MCP servers with a class and init method,
but it's a pattern I recommend—especially if you plan to deploy remotely or want
a clean, maintainable codebase.

👨‍💼 Thanks Olivia! Great job. With this refactor, the journaling app is now
easier to extend, test, and deploy in real-world scenarios. You're set up for
success as your project grows!

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to make a little utility to get an error message from an error
object. It's not complicated, but if you've got a second, you
can <NextDiffLink>check out my changes</NextDiffLink>.
