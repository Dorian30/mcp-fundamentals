# Error Handling

👨‍💼 Nicely done! Now, when something goes wrong, LLMs get a clear, structured
error message which they can use to generate a proper message for the end user.
This makes the app much more robust and user-friendly, and helps everyone know
exactly what went wrong and why.

With proper error handling in place, your tools are ready for real-world use—no
more silent failures or confusing responses!
