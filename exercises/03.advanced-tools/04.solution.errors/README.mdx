# Error Handling

👨‍💼 Nicely done! Now, when something goes wrong, LLMs get a clear, structured
error message which they can use to generate a proper message for the end user.
This makes the app much more robust and user-friendly, and helps everyone know
exactly what went wrong and why.

With proper error handling in place, your tools are ready for real-world use—no
more silent failures or confusing responses!

🧝‍♂️ From here we need a bunch more tools to have a full app experience. So I'm
going to add all those. It's pretty much doing what you just learned over and
over again, but if you'd like to try it yourself, go for it and you can compare
your solution <NextDiffLink>to mine</NextDiffLink>.
