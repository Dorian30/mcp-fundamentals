# Error Handling

👨‍💼 As we add more features, it's inevitable that things will sometimes go
wrong—maybe a user tries to fetch a journal entry that doesn't exist, or there's
a problem saving data. It's important that both users and LLMs get clear,
structured feedback when errors happen.

For this step:

- Update your tools to return error responses in a way that's compatible with
  the MCP spec.
- Make sure errors are surfaced in the response, with `isError: true` and a
  helpful message in the content.

This will make your journaling app more robust and user-friendly, and help LLMs
handle problems gracefully.

Example error response:

```json
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 2,
	"result": {
		"content": [
			{
				"type": "text",
				"text": "Entry with id 123 not found"
			}
		],
		"isError": true
	}
}
```
