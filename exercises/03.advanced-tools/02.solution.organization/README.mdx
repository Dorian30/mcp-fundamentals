# Organization

👨‍💼 Nice work—now our codebase is much easier to navigate. With tool definitions
in their own module, it's easier to add new features and keep things tidy as
the project grows.

	In big projects, you'll probably want to organize this similar to other
	projects that you've made with proper co-location of features rather than
	separating things by category, but in a small project like this one separating
	it by category makes perfect sense.

Onward to building even more powerful tools!
