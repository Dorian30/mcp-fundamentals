# Database

👨‍💼 Database is ready! Our users are now happily creating tags! Now your EpicMe
app can store and retrieve real journal data, setting the foundation for all the
features to come.

Key takeaways:

- You connected your MCP server to a persistent database, moving beyond
  in-memory or static data.
- This unlocks the ability to build tools that interact with real user
  content—an essential step for any practical application.

	The specifics of what happens in your callbacks is up to you!

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to move things around a little bit for the next step. We'll put the
tool definitions into a dedicated module, and then export a function to
initialize all tools for the server. This will make it easier to add new tools
in the future. Feel free to <NextDiffLink>check out my work</NextDiffLink> if
you're curious.

Onward to building and exposing real journaling tools!
