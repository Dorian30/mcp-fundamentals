# Database

👨‍💼 Database is ready! Our users are now happily creating tags! Now your EpicMe
app can store and retrieve real journal data, setting the foundation for all the
features to come.

Key takeaways:

- You connected your MCP server to a persistent database, moving beyond
  in-memory or static data.
- This unlocks the ability to build tools that interact with real user
  content—an essential step for any practical application.
