# Database

👨‍💼 Our users played around with our Math MCP server and it was fun, but they
actually want to write journal entries with their LLM. So let's get
our journaling app ready to store real data! In this step, you'll:

- Import and initialize the database for EpicMe.
- Make sure your server is set up to use the database instance.

For this first tool, we're just going to allow users to create tags for their
journal entries. The code comments should guide you through the steps of
changing our math tool to a `create_tag` tool.

This will lay the groundwork for tools that can create and manage journal tags
and entries.
