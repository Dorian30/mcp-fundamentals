# Organization

👨‍💼 Peter the Product Manager here! As our journaling app grows, it's important
to keep things organized so we can move fast and avoid confusion. Right now, our
tool definitions are all mixed in with the rest of the server code, which will
get messy as we add more features.

For this step:

- Move your tool definitions into a dedicated module.
- Export a function to initialize all tools for the server.
- Set things up so future tools are easy to add and manage.

A clean structure now will save us a lot of headaches as the project evolves!
