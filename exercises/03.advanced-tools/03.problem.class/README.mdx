# Class

👨‍💼 Time to level up our architecture! Most real-world MCP servers are deployed
remotely I recommend using Cloudflare's [agents](https://npm.im/agents) module
which exposes a `McpAgent` class that makes it easy to build a remote MCP
server.

We're going to stick with stdio in this workshop, but we'll pattern after that
so it's easy to switch to a remote server with Cloudflare when we're ready.

So, I'd like you to refactor the journaling app to match that pattern so it's
ready for production and easy to maintain.

- Move your server and database setup into a class.
- Add an `init` method for any async setup (since constructors can't be async).
- Make sure your tools are initialized as part of the class lifecycle.
