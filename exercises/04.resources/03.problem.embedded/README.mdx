# Embedded Resources

👨‍💼 You've already made your resources discoverable and accessible—now let's make
them even more useful! In this step, you'll learn how to embed a resource
directly in your tool responses.

Why does this matter? Sometimes, a tool's output isn't just plain text—it might
be a file, a database record, or some other structured data. By embedding
resource references, you enable clients (and LLMs) to follow links to additional
context, download files, subscribe to updates, or fetch related data on demand.

Your goal in this step:

- Update your tools so that, when they create or return an entry or tag, they
  also include a reference to the corresponding resource (using the
  `type: 'resource'` content type in the response).
- Make sure the resource includes the correct URI and metadata, so clients can
  easily fetch the resource if they want more details.
- Include the resource itself in the response, so clients can use it directly.

This pattern unlocks powerful workflows—tools and resources working together to
provide richer, more actionable results.
