# Resources

👨‍💼 Our users really want to know who's responsible for building this amazing
app! (That's you!). In this step, you'll take your first step toward exposing
structured data from your server—not just as tool responses, but as first-class
resources that clients can discover and read.

Your goal:

- Declare the `resources` capability on your server.
- Register a simple resource called "credits" that provides information about
  the creator of the app. This resource should be available at the URI
  `meta://credits` and return a plain text string with the username of the app's
  creator.

This is your first taste of the MCP resources system. No need for dynamic
templates or database integration yet—just get a static resource registered and
returning a simple value.

Here's an example of a resource:

```ts
agent.server.resource(
	'hello',
	'hello://world',
	{ description: 'A simple hello world resource' },
	async (uri) => {
		return {
			contents: [
				{
					mimeType: 'text/plain',
					text: 'Hello, world!',
					uri: uri.toString(),
				},
			],
		}
	},
)
```
