# Resource Templates

👨‍💼 Now that you've registered a static resource, let's make things more dynamic!
In this step, you'll use MCP's resource templates to expose a whole family of
resources—each with its own unique URI and data.

Resource templates let you define parameterized resources, like `entry://{id}`
or `tag://{id}`. This means clients can discover and read individual entries or
tags by their unique identifiers, just like accessing a file by its path.

Here's a dynamic "hello world" resource template example that reads names from a
database:

```ts
import { ResourceTemplate } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js'

agent.server.resource(
	'hello',
	new ResourceTemplate('hello://{name}', {
		list: async () => {
			// Imagine this is a call to your database to get all names
			const names = await db.getAllNames()
			return {
				resources: names.map((name) => ({
					name,
					uri: `hello://${name}`,
					mimeType: 'text/plain',
				})),
			}
		},
	}),
	{ description: 'Say hello to anyone by name!' },
	async (uri, { name }) => {
		return {
			contents: [
				{
					mimeType: 'text/plain',
					text: `Hello, ${name}!`,
					uri: uri.toString(),
				},
			],
		}
	},
)
```

Notice how the `list` callback queries the database and returns a resource
listing for each name. This pattern is exactly what you'll use to expose entries
and tags from your own database.

Your goal in this step:

- Use resource templates to expose entries and tags from your database, each
  accessible by a unique URI.
- Make sure clients can list all available entries and tags (using the `list`
  callback), and read the details for any specific one.
