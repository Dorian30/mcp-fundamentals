# Ping

👨‍💼 Great job! Now we know we've got an MCP server up and running. From here we
can start adding a bunch of different tools, resources, and more to it.

<summary>🦉 What the StdioServerTransport does</summary>

The `StdioServerTransport` is a simple transport that allows you to connect to
your MCP server using the command line. It's a good way to get started and
understand how MCP servers work.

The MCP Client takes the `command` and `args` you configure and spawns a child
process:

```ts
import { spawn } from 'child_process'

// these come from our config in the MCP Inspector:
const command = 'npm'
const args = [
	'--silent',
	'--prefix',
	'/Users/kody/code/mcp-fundamentals',
	'run',
	'dev:mcp',
]

// Then the MCP client spawns a child process:
const child = spawn(command, args)
```

Then it listens for messages from the child process and sends them to the MCP
server:

```ts
child.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
	console.log(data)
})
```

This is why we use `console.error` in our server, so that the MCP Client can
print it to the console without interfering with the server's output.

It also listens for messages from the MCP server and sends them to the child
process:

```ts
child.stdin.write(JSON.stringify({ jsonrpc: '2.0', method: 'ping' }))
```

Other transport mechanisms exist as well, and while the code for them is
different the underlying concept is the same. Just a server and client
communicating with each other.
