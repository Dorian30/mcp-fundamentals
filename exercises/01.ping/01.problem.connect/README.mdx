# Ping

👨‍💼 Let's get our MCP server running. The TypeScript SDK for MCP supports `ping`
out of the box, so all we need to do is initialize the server, set up a
transport for it, and then it should respond to `ping` requests.

Start in <InlineFile file="src/index.ts" /> and follow the instructions in the
comments.

Right now if you try to run the server, you'll get an error. Let's fix that!
