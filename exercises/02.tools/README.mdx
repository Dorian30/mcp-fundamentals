# Tools

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables language models to interact with
external systems through a concept called "tools." Tools are server-defined
functions that can be invoked by clients (like LLMs or user interfaces) to
perform specific actionsâ€”such as calculations, data lookups, or API callsâ€”using
a standardized protocol.

In MCP, each tool is uniquely named and described, and its expected input
parameters are defined using a JSON Schema. When a client wants to use a tool,
it sends a request specifying the tool's name and the required arguments. The
server executes the tool and returns the result in a structured format, which
can include text, images, audio, or even references to additional resources.

In the future, hopefully we can even respond with UI! For more on this, check
out my post
[The future of AI interaction: Beyond just text](https://www.epicai.pro/the-future-of-ai-interaction-beyond-just-text-w22ps).

For trust and safety, MCP encourages a "human-in-the-loop" approach: users
should be able to see which tools are available, confirm sensitive operations,
and review tool inputs and outputs. The protocol also supports dynamic discovery
of available tools and notifies clients if the tool list changes.

## Example: Defining a Simple Tool

```ts
import { McpServer } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js'

const server = new McpServer(
	{ name: 'hello-world-server', version: '1.0.0' },
	{ capabilities: { tools: {} }, instructions: 'A simple hello world server.' },
)

server.tool('hello', 'Say hello', async () => {
	return {
		content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'Hello, world!' }],
	}
})
```

Example client request:

```json
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"method": "tools/call",
	"params": {
		"name": "hello",
		"arguments": {}
	}
}
```

Example server response:

```json
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"result": {
		"content": [
			{
				"type": "text",
				"text": "Hello, world!"
			}
		],
		"isError": false
	}
}
```

In this exercise, you'll extend your MCP server to declare support for tools and
implement a simple tool that performs addition. You'll start by exposing a basic
tool with a hardcoded response, then evolve it to accept parameters and return
dynamic results based on user input. This will give you hands-on experience with
MCP's tool registration, input validation (using [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
schemas), and result formatting.
