# Simple Tool

👨‍💼 Great job! You've just enabled tool support in your MCP server and registered
your very first tool. This is a foundational step—now your server can expose
functionality to clients in a standardized, discoverable way.

With this in place, you're ready to build more dynamic and interactive tools.
Next, you'll learn how to accept input and return results based on user-provided
arguments.

	**MCP and RAG**: As mentioned in the video, MCP tools have conceptual overlap
	with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). RAG is a technique where an LLM
	retrieves relevant information from external sources and uses that information
	to augment its response generation. With MCP tools, the LLM similarly
	retrieves data from your server through tool calls, then uses that data to
	enhance its responses—making MCP a form of RAG architecture.

Key learnings from this step:

- How to declare the `tools` capability on your MCP server
- How to register a simple tool and return a structured response
- The basics of the MCP tool invocation flow

Onward to dynamic tools!
