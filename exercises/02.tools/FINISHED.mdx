# Tools

👨‍💼 Great job! You've now built a server that can expose tools to clients, handle
arguments, and return dynamic results. This is a huge leap toward building
interactive, AI-powered systems that can do real work for users.

With these skills, you can create all sorts of tools—calculators, data fetchers,
workflow automators, and more. The possibilities are wide open!

Keep going—there's a lot more to explore and build! We're going to take tools a
little further.

🧝‍♀️ We're going to make things a little bit more realistic than a Calculator MCP.
I'm going to update everything to be a full journaling application that is 100%
accessible through MCP, complete with database and everything. You can take
a <NextDiffLink>look at the diff here</NextDiffLink> if you're curious to check
out my changes. I will also be restructuring our MCP server to be structured in
a similar manner as Cloudflare MCP servers are structured. We'll be moving over
to a `class`. That change will be in the diff as well.
