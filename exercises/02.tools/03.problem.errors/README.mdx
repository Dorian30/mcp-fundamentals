# Error Handling

👨‍💼 As we add more features, it's inevitable that things will sometimes go
wrong—maybe a user tries to fetch a journal entry that doesn't exist, or there's
a problem saving data. It's important that both users and LLMs get clear,
structured feedback when errors happen.

Example error response:

```json
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 2,
	"result": {
		"content": [
			{
				"type": "text",
				"text": "Entry with id 123 not found"
			}
		],
		"isError": true
	}
}
```

Luckily for us, the MCP TypeScript SDK handles errors automatically. So all you
need to do is throw an error from your tool, and the SDK will handle the rest!

For this step, we're going to say that tag names cannot include the word
"error". If it does, throw an error with a descriptive message and then try it
out in the inspector. You'll notice the `isError` field is set to `true` and the
content is the helpful error message you provided.
